# Databases

## MySQL

1. Start a MySQL server.

	1. Launch Terminator.

	1. Type ***d run --name galatians -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=lovethepoor -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0.22***.

	1. This runs a Docker image called ***galatians*** in the background.

	1. Type ***d logs galatians*** to see its startup logs.

	1. Type ***telnet localhost 3307***.

		```
		Trying ::1...
		telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
		Trying 127.0.0.1...
		telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
		```

		This command fails because nothing is running on port 3307.

	1. Type ***telnet localhost 3306***.

		```
		Trying ::1...
		Connected to localhost.
		Escape character is '^]'.
		J
		8.0.22	Wxb;bOï¿½C(=k~|Mcaching_sha2_password
		```

		This command works because MySQL is running on port 3306.

	1. Type ***<CONTROL+]>*** and then type ***quit*** to exit out of telnet on port 3306.

	1. Type ***d stop galatians***.

	1. Type ***telnet localhost 3306***. This command fails because MySQL is stopped.

	1. Type ***d rm galatians***.

	1. Type ***d start galatians***. This command fails because we deleted the Docker container called ***galatians***.

	1. Type ***d run --name galatians -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=lovethepoor -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0.22*** to recreate the Docker container.

	1. Type ***d exec -it galatians mysql -uroot -p*** to run the MySQL client that exists on the MySQL server. Your password is ***lovethepoor***.

		The command is split into two parts. The first part, ***d exec -it galatians***, tells Docker to execute a command on the ***galatians*** container. The second part, ***mysql -uroot -p***, is the command that is run on the container itself.

		The argument ***-uroot*** signifies the root user for MySQL and not the root user for the computer. That is why the password is ***lovethepoor*** and not the password you used to login to your computer.

	1. Type ***show databases;***. This lists the databases available in MySQL.

		```
		+--------------------+
		| Database           |
		+--------------------+
		| information_schema |
		| mysql              |
		| performance_schema |
		| sys                |
		+--------------------+
		```

	1. Type ***use mysql;***.

	1. Type ***show tables;***. This lists the tables in the ***mysql*** database. Note that the MySQL server happens to have a database within it called ***mysql***. This is the ***mysql*** database and not the the ***mysql*** client referenced in ***d exec -it galatians mysql -uroot -p***.

	1. Type ***use information_schema;***.

	1. Type ***show tables;***.

	1. Type ***quit*** to exit the container.

	1. Type ***d stop galatians*** and  ***d start galatians*** to restart the container. This step is not necessary but is written here so you know how to restart a container based on its name.

1. Connect to a MySQL server with a MySQL client over the network.

	1. Get your IP.

	1. Type ***d run --rm -it mysql:8.0.22 mysql -h192.168.xxx.xxx -uroot -p***. Replace ***192.168.xxx.xxx*** with your IP.

	1. Type ***quit*** to exit the container.

## SQL

1. Connect to MySQL.

	1. Launch Terminator.

	1. Type ***d exec -it galatians mysql -uroot -p***.

1. Create a database.

	1. Type ***create database mydata;***.

	1. Type ***show databases;***.

		```
		+--------------------+
		| Database           |
		+--------------------+
		| information_schema |
		| mydata             |
		| mysql              |
		| performance_schema |
		| sys                |
		+--------------------+
		```

	1. Type ***use mydata;*** to go into your newly created database;

	1. Type ***show tables;*** to see that there are no tables;

1. Create a table.

	1. Type ***create table Book (bookId bigint primary key, authorId bigint, description varchar(75), name varchar(75));*** to create your first table.

	1. Type ***desc Book;*** to describe your table;

		```
		+-------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| Field       | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
		+-------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| bookId      | bigint      | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |

		| name        | varchar(75) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		+-------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		```

	1. Type ***show tables;***

		```
		+------------------+
		| Tables_in_mydata |
		+------------------+
		| Book             |
		+------------------+
		```

1. Drop a table.

	1. Type ***drop table Book;***

	1. Type ***show tables;***

	1. Type ***create table Book (bookId bigint primary key, authorId bigint, description varchar(75), name varchar(75));*** to recreate the Book table.

1. Insert into a table.

	1. Type ***create table Author (authorId bigint primary key, description varchar(75), name varchar(75));***.

	1. Type ***show tables;***

	1. Type ***desc Author;***

	1. Type ***insert into Author values (1, "Paul was the least of the apostles.", "Paul");***

1. Select from a table.

	1. Type ***select * from Author;***

		```
		+----------+-------------------------------------+------+
		| authorId | description                         | name |
		+----------+-------------------------------------+------+
		|        1 | Paul was the least of the apostles. | Paul |
		+----------+-------------------------------------+------+

	1. Type ***insert into Author values (2, "Peter betrayed Jesus three times.", "Peter");***

		```
		ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '2' for key 'Author.PRIMARY'

1. Explain why the command ***d run --rm -it mysql:8.0.22 mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p*** does not work.

	1. Type ***sudo dnf install mysql*** to install the MySQL client on your local machine.

	1. Type ***mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p***. This command works. Why does this work? As a clue, type ***d ps*** to list all the running Docker containers.

1. Repeat the MySQL tutorial but for PostgreSQL and send the instructor your tutorial.
