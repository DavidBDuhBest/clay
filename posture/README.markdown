## Control and Caps Lock Are Swapped

The Caps Lock is hardly ever used. Control is used extensively for coding.

Swapping Caps Lock and Control allows you to avoid wristlocks and [dor de punho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wristlock). You only have 2 hands.

Your ability to work depends on your ability to avoid carpal tunnel.
