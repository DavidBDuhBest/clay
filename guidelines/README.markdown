# Guidelines

Liferay Basic Training was originally designed to be learned in cohorts of 24 people. The following guidelines are meant to maximize the speed and depth of learning.

## For Everyone

1. Never touch someone else's keyboard.

	1. This forces the listener to listen ***and*** do.

	1. This forces the speaker to speak clearly.

1. Never answer the same question more than 2 times.

	1. This forces everyone to teach.

	1. Pick 1 person to come up with a secret word. Ask that person to share it with only 2 other people who can only share it with 2 other people. Notice that the secret word quickly spreads to 24 people.

	1. This is a mental exercise if you are not in a cohort. But if you are in a cohort, get up and do the above exercise.

1. Break guidelines when they do not achieve their purpose.

	1. This guideline to break a guideline is also a guideline.

## For the Trainees

1. Do not just read the instructions. Do what the instructions say. There are milestones spread throughout the training that makes it very easy to see who practiced the training vs. those who only read the training. Reading is not learning. Learning requires doing.

1. Find a partner. Many of the exercises cannot be done by yourself.

1. Push yourself.

## For the Trainers

1. Do not spoon feed. Guide and mentor. That means not giving people answers but guiding people to learn to find their own answers.

1. Weed out anyone who is lazy. Not knowing is easy to fix. Not trying is hard to fix.
